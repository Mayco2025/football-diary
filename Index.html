              <h3>From Ethiopia with Love</h3>
              <p>I've been playing football since I was about three years old. From an early age, I dreamed of becoming a professional player. My family supported my passion‚Äîthey even bought me my first football. By the time I was nine, I was already playing with people in their 20s. Even though I was much younger, they saw my talent and gave me a chance. Sometimes, they'd even argue over who got to have me on their team!</p>

              <h3>‚ù§Ô∏è How I Became a Manchester United Fan</h3>
              <p>It all started when I was in 3rd grade. One of my close friends kept talking about Manchester United, and his passion made me curious. I decided to watch one of their matches ‚Äî and just like that, I was hooked. I became addicted to watching Man Utd games. Back in those days, I would go out late into the night just to find a place to watch their matches. I even saved up to buy the jersey, no matter how hard it was to find one in Ethiopia. From that moment, Manchester United became more than a team ‚Äî it became a part of me.</p>

              <h3>My First Trophy</h3>
              <p>After moving to Japan, I joined local Ethiopian teams and played with the same passion I had as a kid in Ethiopia. One unforgettable moment came with the Kilimanjaro team, where I was honored as the Top Goal Scorer ‚Äî my first official recognition. That trophy wasn‚Äôt just for goals; it symbolized my journey, dedication, and deep love for football.</p>

              <h3>üèÜ My Second Trophy</h3>
              <p>After joining the Kilimanjaro team in Japan, I had another unforgettable moment during a futsal tournament. I scored more than 8 goals in just 5 matches, including the winning goal in the final that secured the championship for our team. It was a proud moment that proved how far passion and persistence can take you‚Äîeven on a new stage, in a new country.</p>
